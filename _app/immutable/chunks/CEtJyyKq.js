# My First Blog Post

I decided to make a blog, as opposed to writing one. Since this website is purely for fun, I don't feel the need to write about anything important or to write anything at all if I don't feel like it. I need one post though, because I'm too lazy to make this work with zero posts.`;export{t as default};

<description>My First Post</description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My First Blog Post</h1>
<p>I decided to make a blog, as opposed to writing one. Since this website is purely for fun, I don&#39;t feel the need to write about anything important or to write anything at all if I don&#39;t feel like it. I need one post though, because I&#39;m too lazy to make this work with zero posts.</p>

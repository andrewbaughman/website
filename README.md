# DruLand

This is my website. 

It exists for me to have fun and do things that interest me.

## Development Setup

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

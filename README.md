This is my website. 

It exists for me to have fun and do things that interest me.

## Development Setup

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Deployment

To deploy the website, run `npm run deploy`
